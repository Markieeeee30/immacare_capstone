      <p>
        Postnatal care focuses on the physical and emotional well-being of the mother and baby after childbirth. It includes medical checkups, breastfeeding support, and recovery monitoring to ensure a smooth transition into motherhood.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">What’s Included in Postnatal Care</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Postpartum check-ups for mother and baby</li>
        <li>Monitoring for infections or complications</li>
        <li>Breastfeeding guidance and lactation support</li>
        <li>Family planning and contraceptive counseling</li>
