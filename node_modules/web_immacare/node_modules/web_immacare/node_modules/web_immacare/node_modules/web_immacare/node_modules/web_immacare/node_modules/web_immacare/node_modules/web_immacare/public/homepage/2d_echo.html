      <p>
        A 2D Echocardiography (2D Echo) is a non-invasive ultrasound test that provides a detailed image of the heart’s structure and function. It allows doctors to assess how well your heart chambers and valves are working in real time.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">What is a 2D Echo For?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Evaluating the size and shape of the heart</li>
        <li>Checking heart valve function</li>
        <li>Detecting abnormalities such as murmurs or heart defects</li>
        <li>Assessing heart pumping strength (ejection fraction)</li>
        <li>Monitoring patients with heart disease or hypertension</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        During the procedure, a transducer is placed on your chest to send and receive sound waves. These waves create moving images of your heart, displayed on a monitor for the doctor’s assessment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No special preparation is required.</li>
        <li>Wear comfortable clothing for easy access to your chest area.</li>
        <li>Follow any additional instructions provided by your doctor.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">Results and Follow-up</h2>
      <p>
        The results of your 2D Echo help your physician understand your heart’s condition and recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or further tests if needed.
