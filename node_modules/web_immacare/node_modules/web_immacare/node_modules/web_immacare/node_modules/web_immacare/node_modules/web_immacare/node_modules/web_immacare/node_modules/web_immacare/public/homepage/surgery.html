      <p>
        Surgery is a specialized branch of medicine that focuses on diagnosing and treating diseases, injuries, and deformities through operative techniques. Our surgical team uses advanced technology and sterile procedures to ensure patient safety and successful recovery.

      <h2 class="section-title">Common Surgical Procedures</h2>
      <img src="../assets/images/surg2.jpg" alt="Operating Room" />
      <p>
        Our clinic offers a range of minor and major surgical procedures including appendectomy, hernia repair, gallbladder surgery, biopsy, and wound suturing. Each procedure is performed under strict safety standards to ensure comfort and efficiency.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Pre-Operative & Post-Operative Care</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to surgery, patients undergo thorough evaluations and diagnostic tests. Post-operative care includes pain management, wound care, and monitoring for any signs of infection or complications to promote faster healing.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Minimally Invasive Surgery</h2>
      <p>
        Our clinic embraces modern techniques such as laparoscopic and endoscopic surgeries that require smaller incisions, resulting in shorter recovery times and reduced scarring.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Emergency & Elective Surgeries</h2>
      <img src="../assets/images/surg3.jpg" alt="Emergency Surgery Team" />
      <p>
        We provide both emergency procedures (such as trauma or acute appendicitis) and elective surgeries (such as gallbladder removal or hernia repair). Each case is assessed carefully to determine the safest and most effective approach.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">When to Consult a Surgeon</h2>
      <p>
        Consult a surgeon if you experience persistent pain, abnormal lumps, internal bleeding, or if other medical treatments have not resolved your condition. Early consultation can prevent complications and improve treatment outcomes.
