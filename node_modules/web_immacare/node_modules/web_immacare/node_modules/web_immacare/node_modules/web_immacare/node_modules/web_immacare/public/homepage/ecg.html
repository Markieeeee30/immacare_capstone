      <p>
        An Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a painless and non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of the heart. It helps doctors detect irregularities in heart rhythm, rate, and structure.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Why You Might Need an ECG</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chest pain or shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Irregular heartbeat or palpitations</li>
        <li>Pre-employment or annual physical exams</li>
        <li>Monitoring of heart disease or hypertension</li>
        <li>Pre-surgical evaluation</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Quick Fact:</strong> An ECG only takes a few minutes and provides your doctor with valuable insights into your heart’s electrical activity.

      <img src="../assets/images/ecg2.jpg" alt="ECG monitor display" />
      <p>
        During an ECG, small electrodes are placed on your chest, arms, and legs. The test measures the heart’s electrical impulses, which appear as wave patterns on a monitor or printout for medical evaluation.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Preparation and Safety</h2>
      <p>
        - No fasting is needed before an ECG.<br />
        - Avoid lotions or oils on the chest area before testing.<br />
        - The test is completely safe, quick, and causes no discomfort.
