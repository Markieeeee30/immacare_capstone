      <p>
        A hearing screening test is a quick and simple procedure that determines whether a person has normal hearing or potential hearing loss. Early detection is key to preventing speech delays and communication challenges.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Who Should Get a Hearing Test</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Newborns and infants (as part of newborn screening)</li>
        <li>Children with speech or learning delays</li>
        <li>Adults exposed to loud environments</li>
        <li>Seniors experiencing hearing difficulty</li>
        <li>Patients with frequent ear infections</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">Types of Hearing Screening</h2>
      <img src="../assets/images/hearing2.jpg" alt="Audiometry equipment" />
      <p>
        - <strong>Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE):</strong> Common for newborns and infants.<br />
        - <strong>Pure Tone Audiometry:</strong> Used for children and adults to check sensitivity to sound.<br />
        - <strong>Tympanometry:</strong> Assesses middle ear function.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        The screening is non-invasive, painless, and lasts only a few minutes. If results indicate possible hearing loss, a comprehensive audiological assessment may be recommended.
