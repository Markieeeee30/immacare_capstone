      <p>
        The Non-Stress Test (NST) is a safe and non-invasive procedure used to monitor the baby’s heart rate and movements during pregnancy. It helps ensure that the baby is getting enough oxygen and is responding normally inside the womb.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">When an NST is Recommended</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High-risk pregnancies (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)</li>
        <li>Reduced fetal movement</li>
        <li>Pregnancies past the due date</li>
        <li>Multiple pregnancies (twins or more)</li>
        <li>Monitoring of fetal health before delivery</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> The NST helps doctors assess the baby’s well-being and determine if further testing or early delivery may be necessary.
      </blockquote>

      <h2 class="section-title">How the Test is Done</h2>
      <img src="../assets/images/nst2.jpg" alt="NST fetal heart monitor" />
      <p>
        During the test, a belt with sensors is placed around the mother’s abdomen to record the baby’s heartbeat and movement. The procedure usually lasts 20–40 minutes and is completely painless.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">What the Results Mean</h2>
      <p>
        - A “reactive” NST means the baby’s heart rate increases appropriately with movement — a good sign of health.<br />
        - A “non-reactive” NST may require additional tests to ensure the baby’s safety.
